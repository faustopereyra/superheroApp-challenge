# Superhero App Challenge

Welcome to the Superhero App Challenge! This project is designed to demonstrate my abilities in web development using a modern tech stack including React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. It involves fetching and displaying a list of superheroes along with their stats from an external API.

## Project Overview

This Superhero App fetches data from the [Superhero API](https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/) and displays a grid of superheroes. Users can view detailed stats for each superhero by clicking on their cards. The app is built with React for the UI, Redux Toolkit for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Axios for making HTTP requests.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Superhero App running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Start by cloning the project to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/faustopereyra/superheroApp-challenge.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd superheroApp-challenge
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the necessary npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

- **Development Mode**

  To run the app in development mode, execute:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/). The page will reload if you make edits.

- **Production Build**

  Build the app for production to the `build` folder:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  This command optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Features

- **Superhero Grid**: Displays a grid of superheroes fetched from the Superhero API.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS is used to ensure the app is responsive and works well on a variety of devices.
